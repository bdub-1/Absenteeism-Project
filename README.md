# Absenteeism-Project from Business Analyst course on Udemy.

This project consisted of three segments. 
1) Preprocess CSV data in python using pandas library.

2) * Use predictive model
  a) implement machine learning module to obtain output of predicted values.
  b) import data into MySQL workbench.

3) Vizualize data in tableau

* The machine learning module was a given file for the scope of the course.  
* Due to package version conflicts, I was unable to implement the given ML algorithm and opted to use the given CSV output file instead.
* Instead of connecting pymysql to cursor, I directly impored csv to mysql workbench instead.
