# Absenteeism-Project from Business Analyst course on Udemy.

This project consisted of three segments. 
1) Preprocess CSV data in python using pandas library.

2) Implement given Machine Learning module to obtain predicted outcomes.

3) Vizualize data in tableau

* The machine learning module was a given file for the scope of the course to simulate working in a data science team as a BI analyst.
* Due to package version conflicts, I was unable to implement the given ML algorithm and opted to use the given CSV output file instead.
* Instead of connecting pymysql to cursor, I directly impored csv to mysql workbench instead.
